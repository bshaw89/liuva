The Imperial Legion is a [[For Players/Factions/Factions\|faction]] representing the military arm of the Guidovan Empire. The island of Liuva is technically under Imperial rule, having been conquered nearly a century ago. The Legion has erected forts all over Liuva to reinforce their presence and enforce Imperial law.

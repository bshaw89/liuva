***
A [[For Players/Factions/Factions\|faction]] of native wanders and great hunters residing in the wild Argaith forests. It's said they were blessed by the [[For Players/Powers That Be/The Patrons\|Patrons]] after rejecting the [[For Players/Factions/The Trine Temple\|Trine]]. They are seldom seen outside the Argaith.

## *Fen Folk on the Argaith*

>[!quote] Opinion
>Wild folk, big. Decent enough when they wander into Fenigast, but rough and likely to involve you in some dangerous hunting escapade -- or forget you can’t navigate those deep woods as easily as they can.

>[!question] Wants
>Establish a trading post at the edge of the Argaith for their hides, mead, and honey to avoid them coming into Fenigast.

>(And please stop smashing Imperial wagons because it’s bringing trouble from the Logondon caravans and more Imperials)
